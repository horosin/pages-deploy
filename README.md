## Why

- free hosting is great
- great to host personal pages, projects and documentation
- CI means better life

## Limitations

- for private projects paid plan is required
- for private projects there's a limit of 2000 CI minutes
- only static content

## Examples for frameworks

All of the frameworks require copying `index.html` to `404.html` in order to handle routing properly.

### Vue

[Demo project here](../pages-demo-vue)

Follow official documentation for route configuration: (`vue.config.js `)
https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#github-pages

### React

[Demo project here](../pages-demo-react)

### Angular

[Demo project here](../pages-demo-angular)


## Alternative for personal page

Use GitHub Profile Readme - [see mine for reference](https://github.com/horosin)
